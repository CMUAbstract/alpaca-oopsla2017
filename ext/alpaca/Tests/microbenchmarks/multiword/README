atomic - a DINO microbenchmark
-------------------------------

The purpose of this benchmark is to determine how much error is introduced into
a computation due to failures.  The failure mode this benchmark helps study is
inconsistency that failures during atomic updates of large regions of NV
memory, followed by restarts of the program's execution.

The program creates a giant array and does passes over it, incrementing each
element.  After each pass, all values in the array should be the same.  if the
atomicity of a pass is violated, the values may differ, if some are incremented
and others are not.  The error of an execution is characterized by a curve that
shows the error as a function of the entry in the array.
